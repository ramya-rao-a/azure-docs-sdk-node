    package: azuremediaplayer
    summary: >-
      Profile that tries to play highest quality possible.

      It builds the buffer to limit potential buffering.

      It does not take the width and height of the player into account when
      switching bitrates.

      For live streams this profile has a backoff from the live edge to avoid
      potential buffering.

    uid: azuremediaplayer.amp.Player.HeuristicProfile.Hybrid
    package: azuremediaplayer
    summary: >-
      Profile that tries to balance quality and speed.

      It builds the buffer more than QuickStart but less than HighQuality.

      It takes the width and height of the player into account when switching
      bitrates.

      For live streams this profile tries to stay close to the live edge.

      This is the default profile.

  - name: LowLatency

    package: azuremediaplayer
    summary: >-
      Profile designed to work alongside Azure Media Services low latency
      feature for live streaming.

      If low latency is not enabled on the stream, this heuristic profile will
      not yield a latency improvement.

    uid: azuremediaplayer.amp.Player.HeuristicProfile.QuickStart
    package: azuremediaplayer
    summary: >-
      Profile that starts the playback as fast as possible.

      It also takes the width and height of the player into account when
      switching bitrates.

      For live streams this profile tries to stay close to the live edge.
