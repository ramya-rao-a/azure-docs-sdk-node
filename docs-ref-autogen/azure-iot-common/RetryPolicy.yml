summary: >
  Interface describing a retry policy object.

  Retry policies are composed of 2 things

  - An algorithm that computes the next time to retry based on the current
  number or retries.

  - An error filter that decides, based on the type of error received, whether a
  retry should happen or not.

  Those 2 components hide behind 2 method calls described in this interface.
