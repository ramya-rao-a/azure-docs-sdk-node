  Options structure used to configure how often the HTTP receiver polls for
  messages.

  Each of these options is mutually exclusive, except for the `drain` boolean.
  Only one `interval`, `at`, `cron` or `manualPolling` shall be present in the
  options structure.

  This is configured by calling <xref:Client.setOptions> with this as a property
  named `receivePolicy` inside of an <xref:HttpTransportOptions> object which is
  inside of an <xref:DeviceClientOptions> object.
