summary: >-
  The allocation policy of this individual enrollment. This policy overrides the
  tenant-level allocation policy.

  - 'hashed': Linked IoT hubs are equally likely to have devices provisioned to
  them.

  - 'geoLatency':  Devices are provisioned to an IoT hub with the lowest latency
  to the device.If multiple linked IoT hubs would provide the same lowest
  latency, the provisioning service hashes devices across those hubs.

  - 'static' : Specification of the desired IoT hub in the enrollment list takes
  priority over the service-level allocation policy.

  - 'custom': Devices are provisioned to an IoT hub based on your own custom
  logic. The provisioning service passes information about the device to the
  logic, and the logic returns the desired IoT hub as well as the desired
  initial configuration. We recommend using Azure Functions to host your logic.
