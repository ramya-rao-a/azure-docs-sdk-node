  A port resource represents a server port on a machine. The port may be
  actively *monitored*,

  i.e., a Dependency Agent is running on its machine, or *discovered*, i.e., its
  existence was

  inferred by observing the data stream from monitored machines. A port is live
  during an interval

  of time, if that port had associated activity during (parts) of that interval.
