      IsNegativeAnomaly contains anomaly status in negative direction for each
      input point. True

      means a negative anomaly has been detected. A negative anomaly means the
      point is detected as

      an anomaly and its real value is smaller than the expected one. The index
      of the array is

      consistent with the input series.

      lowerBoundary, which equals to expectedValue - (100 -
      marginScale)*lowerMargin. Points between

      the boundary can be marked as normal ones in client side. The index of the

      UpperMargins contain upper margin of each input point. UpperMargin is used
      to calculate

      upperBoundary, which equals to expectedValue + (100 -
      marginScale)*upperMargin. Anomalies in

      response can be filtered by upperBoundary and lowerBoundary. By adjusting
      marginScale value,

      less significant anomalies can be filtered in client side. The index of
      the array is

      consistent with the input series.
