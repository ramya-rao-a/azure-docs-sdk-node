    summary: >-
      The location of the certificate store on the compute node into which to
      install the

      certificate. The default value is currentUser. This property is applicable
      only for pools

      configured with Windows nodes (that is, created with
      cloudServiceConfiguration, or with

      virtualMachineConfiguration using a Windows image reference). For Linux
      compute nodes, the

      certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory
      and an environment

      variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for
      this location. For

      certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is
      created in the user's

      home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed
      in that directory.

      Possible values include: 'CurrentUser', 'LocalMachine'

      also be used. The

      default value is My.
