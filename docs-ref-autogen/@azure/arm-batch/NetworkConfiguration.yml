    package: '@azure/arm-batch'
    summary: >-
      The ARM resource identifier of the virtual network subnet which the
      compute nodes of the pool

      will join. This is of the form

      /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.

      The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the
      Azure Batch account.

      The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate
      the number of nodes

      in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the pool
      will partially

      allocate compute nodes and a resize error will occur. The
      'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service

      principal must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based
      Access Control (RBAC)

      role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication
      from the Azure

      Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes. This can
      be verified by

      checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
      (NSG). If

      communication to the compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an
      NSG, then the Batch

      service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. If the
      specified VNet has any

      associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports
      must be enabled for

      inbound communication. For pools created with a virtual machine
      configuration, enable ports

      29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for Windows.
      For pools created

      with a cloud service configuration, enable ports 10100, 20100, and 30100.
      Also enable outbound

      connections to Azure Storage on port 443. For cloudServiceConfiguration
      pools, only 'classic'

      VNETs are supported. For more details see:
