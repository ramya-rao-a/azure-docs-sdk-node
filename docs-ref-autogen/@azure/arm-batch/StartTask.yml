summary: >-
  In some cases the start task may be re-run even though the node was not
  rebooted. Due to this,

  start tasks should be idempotent and exit gracefully if the setup they're
  performing has already

  been done. Special care should be taken to avoid start tasks which create
  breakaway process or

  install/launch services from the start task working directory, as this will
  block Batch from

  being able to re-run the start task.

      The command line of the start task. The command line does not run under a

      expansion. If you want to

      take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the
      command line, for example

      using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.
      Required if any other

      properties of the startTask are specified.

      The maximum number of times the task may be retried. The Batch service
      retries a task if its

      exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the
      number of retries. The

      Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit.
      For example, if the

      maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial
      try and 3 retries).

      If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the
      task. If the maximum

      retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.

    summary: >-
      Whether the Batch service should wait for the start task to complete
      successfully (that is, to

      exit with exit code 0) before scheduling any tasks on the compute node. If
      true and the start

      task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up
      to its maximum retry

      count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed
      successfully after all retries,

      then the Batch service marks the compute node unusable, and will not
      schedule tasks to it.

      This condition can be detected via the node state and scheduling error
      detail. If false, the

      Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case,
      other tasks can

      start executing on the compute node while the start task is still running;
      and even if the

      start task fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The
      default is true.
