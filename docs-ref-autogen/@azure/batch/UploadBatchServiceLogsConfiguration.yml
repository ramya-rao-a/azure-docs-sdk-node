      The end of the time range from which to upload Batch Service log file(s).
      Any log file

      containing a log message in the time range will be uploaded. This means
      that the operation

      might retrieve more logs than have been requested since the entire log
      file is always

      uploaded, but the operation should not retrieve fewer logs than have been
      requested. If

      omitted, the default is to upload all logs available after the startTime.
