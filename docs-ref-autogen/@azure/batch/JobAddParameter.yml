      Details of a Job Manager Task to be launched when the Job is started. If
      the Job does not

      specify a Job Manager Task, the user must explicitly add Tasks to the Job.
      If the Job does

      specify a Job Manager Task, the Batch service creates the Job Manager Task
      when the Job is

      created, and will try to schedule the Job Manager Task before scheduling
      other Tasks in the

      Job. The Job Manager Task's typical purpose is to control and/or monitor
      Job execution, for

      example by deciding what additional Tasks to run, determining when the
      work is complete, etc.

      (However, a Job Manager Task is not restricted to these activities - it is
      a fully-fledged

      Task in the system and perform whatever actions are required for the Job.)
      For example, a Job

      Manager Task might download a file specified as a parameter, analyze the
      contents of that file

      and submit additional Tasks based on those contents.

      Task is to undo

      changes to Compute Nodes made by the Job Preparation Task. Example
      activities include deleting

      local files, or shutting down services that were started as part of Job

      therefore most commonly used with a Job Manager task; if you want to use
      automatic Job

      onAllTasksComplete to noaction and

      update the Job properties to set onAllTasksComplete to terminatejob once
