      The exit code of the program specified on the Task command line. This
      parameter is returned

      only if the Task is in the completed state. The exit code for a process
      reflects the specific

      convention implemented by the application developer for that process. If
      you use the exit code

      value to make decisions in your code, be sure that you know the exit code
      convention used by

      the application process. Note that the exit code may also be generated by
      the Compute Node

      operating system, such as when a process is forcibly terminated.

      The most recent time at which a retry of the Job Preparation Task started
      running. This

      property is set only if the Task was retried (i.e. retryCount is nonzero).
      If present, this is

      typically the same as startTime, but may be different if the Task has been
      restarted for

      reasons other than retry; for example, if the Compute Node was rebooted
      during a retry, then

      the startTime is updated but the lastRetryTime is not.
