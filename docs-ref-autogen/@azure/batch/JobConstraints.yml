    summary: >-
      The maximum number of times each Task may be retried. The Batch service
      retries a Task if its

      exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the
      number of retries. The

      Batch service will try each Task once, and may then retry up to this
      limit. For example, if

      the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a Task up to 4 times (one
      initial try and 3

      retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not
      retry Tasks. If the

      maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries Tasks without limit.
      The default value is

      0 (no retries).

    package: '@azure/batch'
    summary: >-
      The maximum elapsed time that the Job may run, measured from the time the
      Job is created. If

      the Job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service
      terminates it and any Tasks

      that are still running. In this case, the termination reason will be
      MaxWallClockTimeExpiry.

      If this property is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the
      Job may run.
