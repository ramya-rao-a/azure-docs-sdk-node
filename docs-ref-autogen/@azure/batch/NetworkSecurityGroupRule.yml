    summary: >-
      The priority for this rule. Priorities within a Pool must be unique and
      are evaluated in order

      of priority. The lower the number the higher the priority. For example,
      rules could be

      specified with order numbers of 150, 250, and 350. The rule with the order
      number of 150 takes

      precedence over the rule that has an order of 250. Allowed priorities are
      150 to 4096. If any

      reserved or duplicate values are provided the request fails with HTTP
      status code 400.

      be in the range of 0

      to 65535. Each entry in this collection must not overlap any other entry
      (either a range or an

      individual port). If any other values are provided the request fails with
      HTTP status code

      400. The default value is '*'.
