package: '@azure/batch'
summary: >-
  The Job Release Task runs when the Job ends, because of one of the following:
  The user calls the

  Terminate Job API, or the Delete Job API while the Job is still active, the
  Job's maximum wall

  clock time constraint is reached, and the Job is still active, or the Job's
  Job Manager Task

  completed, and the Job is configured to terminate when the Job Manager
  completes. The Job

  Release Task runs on each Node where Tasks of the Job have run and the Job
  Preparation Task ran

  and completed. If you reimage a Node after it has run the Job Preparation
  Task, and the Job ends

  without any further Tasks of the Job running on that Node (and hence the Job
  Preparation Task

  does not re-run), then the Job Release Task does not run on that Compute Node.
  If a Node reboots

  while the Job Release Task is still running, the Job Release Task runs again
  when the Compute

  Node starts up. The Job is not marked as complete until all Job Release Tasks
  have completed.

  The Job Release Task runs in the background. It does not occupy a scheduling
  slot; that is, it

  does not count towards the taskSlotsPerNode limit specified on the Pool.

      The command line of the Job Release Task. The command line does not run
      under a shell, and

      therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment
      variable expansion. If

      you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell
      in the command line,

      for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand"
      in Linux. If the

      command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative
      to the Task working

      directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable

      (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).

      produced in the container outside of AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be
      reflected to the host

      and cannot contain

      more than 64 characters. If you do not specify this property, the Batch

      ID as the Job

      Release Task. If you try to submit a Task with the same id, the Batch
      service rejects the

      request with error code TaskIdSameAsJobReleaseTask; if you are calling the
      REST API directly,

      the HTTP status code is 409 (Conflict).
