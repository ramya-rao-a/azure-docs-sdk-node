    uid: '@azure/batch.NetworkConfiguration.subnetId'
    package: '@azure/batch'
    summary: >-
      The ARM resource identifier of the virtual network subnet which the
      Compute Nodes of the Pool

      will join. This is of the form

      /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.

      The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the
      Azure Batch Account.

      The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate
      the number of Compute

      Nodes in the Pool. If the subnet doesn't have enough free IP addresses,
      the Pool will

      partially allocate Nodes and a resize error will occur. The
      'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service

      principal must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based
      Access Control (RBAC)

      role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication
      from the Azure

      Batch service to be able to schedule Tasks on the Nodes. This can be
      verified by checking if

      the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If
      communication to the

      Nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service
      will set the state

      of the Compute Nodes to unusable. For Pools created with
      virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM

      virtual networks ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but
      for Pools created

      with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are
      supported. If the

      specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then a
      few reserved system

      ports must be enabled for inbound communication. For Pools created with a
      virtual machine

      configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux
      and port 3389 for

      Windows. For Pools created with a cloud service configuration, enable
      ports 10100, 20100, and

      30100. Also enable outbound connections to Azure Storage on port 443. For
      more details see:
