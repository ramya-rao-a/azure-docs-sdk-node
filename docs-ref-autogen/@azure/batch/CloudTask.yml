  Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node.
  Examples of recovery

  operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy Node is rebooted
  or a Compute Node

  disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are
  independent of and are

  not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0,
  an internal retry

  due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all Tasks should be
  idempotent. This

  means Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and restarted without causing
  any corruption or

  duplicate data. The best practice for long running Tasks is to use some form
  of checkpointing.

      operations without

      requiring an Account access key. The token is provided via the
      AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN

      environment variable. The operations that the Task can carry out using the
      token depend on the

      settings. For example, a Task can request Job permissions in order to add

      Job, or check the status of the Job or of other Tasks under the Job.
