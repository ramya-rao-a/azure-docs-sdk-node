      The action the Batch service should take when all Tasks in the Job are in
      the completed state.

      If omitted, the completion behavior is set to noaction. If the current
      value is terminatejob,

      this is an error because a Job's completion behavior may not be changed
      from terminatejob to

      noaction. You may not change the value from terminatejob to noaction -
      that is, once you have

      engaged automatic Job termination, you cannot turn it off again. If you
      try to do this, the

      request fails and Batch returns status code 400 (Bad Request) and an
      'invalid property value'

      error response. If you do not specify this element in a PUT request, it is
      equivalent to

      passing noaction. This is an error if the current value is terminatejob.
      Possible values

      include: 'noAction', 'terminateJob'

      the Pool for a Job

      only when the Job is disabled. The Update Job call will fail if you

      element and the Job is not disabled. If you specify an
      autoPoolSpecification in the poolInfo,

      only the keepAlive property of the autoPoolSpecification can be updated,
      and then only if the

      autoPoolSpecification has a poolLifetimeOption of Job (other job
      properties can be updated as
