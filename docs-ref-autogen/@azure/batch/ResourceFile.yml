    summary: >-
      The blob prefix to use when downloading blobs from an Azure Storage
      container. Only the blobs

      whose names begin with the specified prefix will be downloaded. The
      property is valid only

      when autoStorageContainerName or storageContainerUrl is used. This prefix
      can be a partial

      filename or a subdirectory. If a prefix is not specified, all the files in
      the container will

      be downloaded.

    summary: >-
      The file permission mode attribute in octal format. This property applies
      only to files being

      downloaded to Linux Compute Nodes. It will be ignored if it is specified
      for a resourceFile

      which will be downloaded to a Windows Compute Node. If this property is
      not specified for a

      Linux Compute Node, then a default value of 0770 is applied to the file.

  - name: filePath

    package: '@azure/batch'
    summary: >-
      The location on the Compute Node to which to download the file(s),
      relative to the Task's

      working directory. If the httpUrl property is specified, the filePath is
      required and

      describes the path which the file will be downloaded to, including the
      filename. Otherwise, if

      the autoStorageContainerName or storageContainerUrl property is specified,
      filePath is

      optional and is the directory to download the files to. In the case where
      filePath is used as

      a directory, any directory structure already associated with the input
      data will be retained

      in full and appended to the specified filePath directory. The specified
      relative path cannot

      break out of the Task's working directory (for example by using '..').

  - name: httpUrl

    summary: >-
      The URL of the file to download. The autoStorageContainerName,
      storageContainerUrl and httpUrl

      properties are mutually exclusive and one of them must be specified. If
      the URL points to

      Azure Blob Storage, it must be readable using anonymous access; that is,
      the Batch service

      does not present any credentials when downloading the blob. There are two
      ways to get such a

      URL for a blob in Azure storage: include a Shared Access Signature (SAS)
      granting read

      permissions on the blob, or set the ACL for the blob or its container to
      allow public access.
