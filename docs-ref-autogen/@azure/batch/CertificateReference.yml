      The location of the Certificate store on the Compute Node into which to
      install the

      Certificate. The default value is currentuser. This property is applicable
      only for Pools

      configured with Windows Compute Nodes (that is, created with
      cloudServiceConfiguration, or

      with virtualMachineConfiguration using a Windows Image reference). For
      Linux Compute Nodes,

      the Certificates are stored in a directory inside the Task working
      directory and an

      environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the Task to
      query for this

      location. For Certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs'
      directory is created in

      the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and Certificates
      are placed in that

      directory. Possible values include: 'currentUser', 'localMachine'
