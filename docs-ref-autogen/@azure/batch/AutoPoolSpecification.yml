      A prefix to be added to the unique identifier when a Pool is automatically
      created. The Batch

      service assigns each auto Pool a unique identifier on creation. To
      distinguish between Pools

      created for different purposes, you can specify this element to add a
      prefix to the ID that is

      assigned. The prefix can be up to 20 characters long.

      Whether to keep an auto Pool alive after its lifetime expires. If false,

      deletes the Pool once its lifetime (as determined by the

      that is, when the Job or Job Schedule completes. If true, the Batch
      service does not delete

      the Pool automatically. It is up to the user to delete auto Pools created
      with this option.
