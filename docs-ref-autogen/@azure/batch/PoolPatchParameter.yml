      A list of Packages to be installed on each Compute Node in the Pool.
      Changes to Package

      references affect all new Nodes joining the Pool, but do not affect
      Compute Nodes that are

      already in the Pool until they are rebooted or reimaged. If this element
      is present, it

      replaces any existing Package references. If you specify an empty
      collection, then all Package

      references are removed from the Pool. If omitted, any existing Package
      references are left

      unchanged.

    package: '@azure/batch'
    summary: >-
      A list of Certificates to be installed on each Compute Node in the Pool.
      If this element is

      present, it replaces any existing Certificate references configured on the
      Pool. If omitted,

      any existing Certificate references are left unchanged. For Windows Nodes,
      the Batch service

      installs the Certificates to the specified Certificate store and location.
      For Linux Compute

      Nodes, the Certificates are stored in a directory inside the Task working
      directory and an

      environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the Task to
      query for this

      location. For Certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs'
      directory is created in

      the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and Certificates
      are placed in that

      directory.

      it replaces any existing metadata configured on the Pool. If you specify
      an empty collection,

      any metadata is removed from the Pool. If omitted, any existing metadata
      is left unchanged.

      when the Compute Node

      is added to the Pool or when the Compute Node is restarted. If this
      element is present, it

      overwrites any existing StartTask. If omitted, any existing StartTask is
