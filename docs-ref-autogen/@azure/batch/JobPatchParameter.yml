      The action the Batch service should take when all Tasks in the Job are in
      the completed state.

      If omitted, the completion behavior is left unchanged. You may not change
      the value from

      terminatejob to noaction - that is, once you have engaged automatic Job
      termination, you

      cannot turn it off again. If you try to do this, the request fails with an
      'invalid property

      value' error response; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP
      status code is 400

      (Bad Request). Possible values include: 'noAction', 'terminateJob'

      autoPoolSpecification in the poolInfo,

      only the keepAlive property of the autoPoolSpecification can be updated,
      and then only if the

      autoPoolSpecification has a poolLifetimeOption of Job (other job
      properties can be updated as

      normal). If omitted, the Job continues to run on its current Pool.
