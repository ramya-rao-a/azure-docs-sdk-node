      The path from the location that the 'authentication' property [say, a SAS
      URI to the blob

      container] refers to, to the location of the artifacts. This can be used
      to differentiate

      different versions of the artifacts. Or, different types of artifacts like
      binaries or

      templates. The location referenced by the authentication property
      concatenated with this

      optional artifactRoot path forms the artifact source location where the
      artifacts are expected

      to be found.
