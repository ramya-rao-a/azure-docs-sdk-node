    summary: >-
      Health statuses have following meanings. The 'healthy' status shows that
      the endpoint is

      accepting messages as expected. The 'unhealthy' status shows that the
      endpoint is not

      accepting messages as expected and IoT Hub is retrying to send data to
      this endpoint. The

      status of an unhealthy endpoint will be updated to healthy when IoT Hub
      has established an

      eventually consistent state of health. The 'dead' status shows that the
      endpoint is not

      accepting messages, after IoT Hub retried sending messages for the retrial
      period. See IoT Hub

      metrics to identify errors and monitor issues with endpoints. The
      'unknown' status shows that

      the IoT Hub has not established a connection with the endpoint. No
      messages have been

      delivered to or rejected from this endpoint. Possible values include:
      'unknown', 'healthy',

      'degraded', 'unhealthy', 'dead'
