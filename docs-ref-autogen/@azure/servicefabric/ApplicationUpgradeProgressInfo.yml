      the existing application description. This means that if the parameters

      existing parameters on the applications will be overwritten with the empty
      parameters list.

      This would result in the application using the default value of the
      parameters from the

      application manifest. If you do not want to change any existing parameter
      values, please get

      the application parameters first using the GetApplicationInfo query and
      then supply those

      values as Parameters in this ApplicationUpgradeDescription.
