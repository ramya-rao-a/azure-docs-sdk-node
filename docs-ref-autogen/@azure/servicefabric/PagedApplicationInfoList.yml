      The continuation token parameter is used to obtain next set of results.
      The continuation token

      is included in the response of the API when the results from the system do
      not fit in a single

      response. When this value is passed to the next API call, the API returns
      next set of results.

      If there are no further results, then the continuation token is not
      included in the response.
