      closing during the

      application/cluster upgrade and disabling node.

      The endpoint exposed on this instance is removed prior to starting the
      delay, which prevents

      new connections to this instance.

      In addition, clients that have subscribed to service endpoint change

      events(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.fabric.fabricclient.servicemanagementclient.registerservicenotificationfilterasync),

      can do

      the following upon receiving the endpoint removal notification:

      - Stop sending new requests to this instance.

      - Close existing connections after in-flight requests have completed.

      - Connect to a different instance of the service partition for future
      requests.

      Note, the default value of InstanceCloseDelayDuration is 0, which
      indicates that there won't

      be any delay or removal of the endpoint prior to closing the instance.
