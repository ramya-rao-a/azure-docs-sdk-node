    summary: >
      Defines a map with max percentage unhealthy applications for specific
      application types.

      Each entry specifies as key the application type name and as value an
      integer that represents

      the MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications percentage used to evaluate the
      applications of the

      specified application type.

      The application type health policy map can be used during cluster health
      evaluation to

      describe special application types.

      The application types included in the map are evaluated against the
      percentage specified in

      the map, and not with the global MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications defined
      in the cluster health

      policy.

      The applications of application types specified in the map are not counted
      against the global

      pool of applications.

      For example, if some applications of a type are critical, the cluster
      administrator can add an

      entry to the map for that application type

      and assign it a value of 0% (that is, do not tolerate any failures).

      All other applications can be evaluated with
      MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications set to 20% to

      tolerate some failures out of the thousands of application instances.

      The application type health policy map is used only if the cluster
      manifest enables

      application type health evaluation using the configuration entry for

      HealthManager/EnableApplicationTypeHealthEvaluation.

      The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy applications before reporting
      an error. For

      example, to allow 10% of applications to be unhealthy, this value would be
      10.

      The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of applications
      that can be

      unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.

      If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy
      application, the health is

      evaluated as Warning.

      This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy applications over
      the total number of

      application instances in the cluster, excluding applications of
      application types that are

      included in the ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap.

      The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
      applications. Default

      percentage is zero. Default value: 0.

      The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy nodes before reporting an

      allow 10% of nodes to be unhealthy, this value would be 10.

      The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of nodes that

      before the cluster is considered in error.

      If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy node,
      the health is

      The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy nodes
      over the total number

      of nodes in the cluster.

      The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
      nodes. Default

      percentage is zero.


      In large clusters, some nodes will always be down or out for repairs, so
      this percentage

      should be configured to tolerate that. Default value: 0.
