### YamlMime:TSType
name: ChaosTargetFilter
uid: '@azure/servicefabric.ChaosTargetFilter'
package: '@azure/servicefabric'
summary: >-
  Defines all filters for targeted Chaos faults, for example, faulting only
  certain node types or

  faulting only certain applications.

  If ChaosTargetFilter is not used, Chaos faults all cluster entities. If
  ChaosTargetFilter is

  used, Chaos faults only the entities that meet the ChaosTargetFilter

  specification. NodeTypeInclusionList and ApplicationInclusionList allow a
  union semantics only.

  It is not possible to specify an intersection

  of NodeTypeInclusionList and ApplicationInclusionList. For example, it is not
  possible to

  specify "fault this application only when it is on that node type."

  Once an entity is included in either NodeTypeInclusionList or
  ApplicationInclusionList, that

  entity cannot be excluded using ChaosTargetFilter. Even if

  applicationX does not appear in ApplicationInclusionList, in some Chaos
  iteration applicationX

  can be faulted because it happens to be on a node of nodeTypeY that is
  included

  in NodeTypeInclusionList. If both NodeTypeInclusionList and
  ApplicationInclusionList are null or

  empty, an ArgumentException is thrown.

      A list of application URIs to include in Chaos faults.

      All replicas belonging to services of these applications are amenable to
      replica faults

      (restart replica, remove replica, move primary, and move secondary) by
      Chaos.

      Chaos may restart a code package only if the code package hosts replicas
      of these applications

      only.

      If an application does not appear in this list, it can still be faulted in
      some Chaos

      iteration if the application ends up on a node of a node type that is
      included in

      NodeTypeInclusionList.

      However, if applicationX is tied to nodeTypeY through placement
      constraints and applicationX

      is absent from ApplicationInclusionList and nodeTypeY is absent from
      NodeTypeInclusionList,

      then applicationX will never be faulted.

      At most 1000 application names can be included in this list, to increase
      this number, a config

      upgrade is required for MaxNumberOfApplicationsInChaosEntityFilter
      configuration.

      A list of node types to include in Chaos faults.

      All types of faults (restart node, restart code package, remove replica,
      restart replica, move

      primary, and move secondary) are enabled for the nodes of these node
      types.

      If a node type (say NodeTypeX) does not appear in the
      NodeTypeInclusionList, then node level

      faults (like NodeRestart) will never be enabled for the nodes of

      NodeTypeX, but code package and replica faults can still be enabled for
      NodeTypeX if an

      application in the ApplicationInclusionList.

      happens to reside on a node of NodeTypeX.

      At most 100 node type names can be included in this list, to increase this
      number, a config

      upgrade is required for MaxNumberOfNodeTypesInChaosEntityFilter
      configuration.
