summary: >
  Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service
  where two replicas

  from the same partition should never be placed in the same fault or upgrade
  domain.

  While this is not common it can expose the service to an increased risk of
  concurrent failures

  due to unplanned outages or other cases of subsequent/concurrent failures. As
  an example,

  consider a case where replicas are deployed across different data center, with
  one replica per

  location. In the event that one of the datacenters goes offline, normally the
  replica that was

  placed in that datacenter will be packed into one of the remaining
  datacenters. If this is not

  desirable then this policy should be set.
