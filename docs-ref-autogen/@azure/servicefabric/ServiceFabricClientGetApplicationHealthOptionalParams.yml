    summary: >
      Allows filtering of the deployed applications health state objects
      returned in the result of

      application health query based on their health state.

      The possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the
      following health

      states. Only deployed applications that match the filter will be returned.

      All deployed applications are used to evaluate the aggregated health
      state. If not specified,

      all entries are returned.

      The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value could be a
      combination of these

      values, obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.

      For example, if the provided value is 6 then health state of deployed
      applications with

      HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.

      - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

      - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to
      return no results

      on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

      - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is
      2.

      - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The
      value is 4.

      - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The
      value is 8.

      - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is
      65535. Default

      value: 0.
