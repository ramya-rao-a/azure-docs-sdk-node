      Duration in seconds, to wait before a stateless instance is closed, to

      application/cluster

      upgrade, only for those instances which have a non-zero delay duration
      configured in the

      service description. See InstanceCloseDelayDurationSeconds property in
      $ref:

      "#/definitions/StatelessServiceDescription.yaml" for details.

      Note, the default value of InstanceCloseDelayDurationInSeconds is
      4294967295, which indicates

      that the behavior will entirely depend on the delay configured in the
      stateless service
