      properties

      corresponds to a flag, specified below, which, if set, indicate that the
      property is

      specified.

      This property can be a combination of those flags obtained using bitwise
      'OR' operator.

      For example, if the provided value is 6 then the flags for
      ReplicaRestartWaitDuration (2) and

      QuorumLossWaitDuration (4) are set.

      - None - Does not indicate any other properties are set. The value is
      zero.

      - TargetReplicaSetSize/InstanceCount - Indicates whether the
      TargetReplicaSetSize property

      (for Stateful services) or the InstanceCount property (for Stateless
      services) is set. The

      value is 1.

      - ReplicaRestartWaitDuration - Indicates the ReplicaRestartWaitDuration
      property is set. The

      value is  2.

      - QuorumLossWaitDuration - Indicates the QuorumLossWaitDuration property
      is set. The value is

      4.

      - StandByReplicaKeepDuration - Indicates the StandByReplicaKeepDuration
      property is set. The

      value is 8.

      - MinReplicaSetSize - Indicates the MinReplicaSetSize property is set. The
      value is 16.

      - PlacementConstraints - Indicates the PlacementConstraints property is
      set. The value is 32.

      - PlacementPolicyList - Indicates the ServicePlacementPolicies property is
      set. The value is

      64.

      - Correlation - Indicates the CorrelationScheme property is set. The value
      is 128.

      - Metrics - Indicates the ServiceLoadMetrics property is set. The value is
      256.

      - DefaultMoveCost - Indicates the DefaultMoveCost property is set. The
      value is 512.

      - ScalingPolicy - Indicates the ScalingPolicies property is set. The value
      is 1024.

      - ServicePlacementTimeLimit - Indicates the ServicePlacementTimeLimit
      property is set. The

      value is 2048.

      - MinInstanceCount - Indicates the MinInstanceCount property is set. The
      value is 4096.

      - MinInstancePercentage - Indicates the MinInstancePercentage property is
      set. The value is

      8192.

      Duration in seconds, to wait before a stateless instance is closed, to
      allow the active

      requests to drain gracefully. This would be effective when the instance is
      closing during the

      application/cluster upgrade and disabling node.

      The endpoint exposed on this instance is removed prior to starting the
      delay, which prevents

      new connections to this instance.

      In addition, clients that have subscribed to service endpoint change

      events(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.fabric.fabricclient.servicemanagementclient.registerservicenotificationfilterasync),

      can do

      the following upon receiving the endpoint removal notification:

      - Stop sending new requests to this instance.

      - Close existing connections after in-flight requests have completed.

      - Connect to a different instance of the service partition for future
      requests.
