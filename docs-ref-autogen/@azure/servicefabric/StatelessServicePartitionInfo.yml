      MinInstanceCount is the minimum number of instances that must be up to
      meet the

      EnsureAvailability safety check during operations like upgrade or
      deactivate node.

      The actual number that is used is max( MinInstanceCount, ceil(
      MinInstancePercentage/100.0 *

      InstanceCount) ).

      Note, if InstanceCount is set to -1, during MinInstanceCount computation
      -1 is first converted

      into the number of nodes on which the instances are allowed to be placed
      according to the

      placement constraints on the service.
