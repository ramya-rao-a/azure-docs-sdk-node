      The identity of the service. This ID is an encoded representation of the
      service name. This is

      used in the REST APIs to identify the service resource.

      Starting in version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the "\~"
      character. For

      example, if the service name is "fabric:/myapp/app1/svc1",

      the service identity would be "myapp~app1\~svc1" in 6.0+ and
      "myapp/app1/svc1" in previous

      versions.
