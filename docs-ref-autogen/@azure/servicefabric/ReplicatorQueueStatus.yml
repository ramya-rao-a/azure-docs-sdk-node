summary: >-
  Provides various statistics of the queue used in the service fabric
  replicator.

  Contains information about the service fabric replicator like the
  replication/copy queue

  utilization, last acknowledgement received timestamp, etc.

  Depending on the role of the replicator, the properties in this type imply
  different meanings.

      On a secondary replicator, this is semantically the highest sequence
      number of the in-order

      operation received from the primary.
