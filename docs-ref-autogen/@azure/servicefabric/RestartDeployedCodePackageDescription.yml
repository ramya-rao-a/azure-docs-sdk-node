    summary: >-
      The instance ID for currently running entry point. For a code package
      setup entry point (if

      specified) runs first and after it finishes main entry point is started.

      Each time entry point executable is run, its instance ID will change. If 0
      is passed in as the

      code package instance ID, the API will restart the code package with
      whatever instance ID it

      is currently running.

      If an instance ID other than 0 is passed in, the API will restart the code
      package only if the

      current Instance ID matches the passed in instance ID.

      Note, passing in the exact instance ID (not 0) in the API is safer,
      because if ensures at most

      one restart of the code package.
