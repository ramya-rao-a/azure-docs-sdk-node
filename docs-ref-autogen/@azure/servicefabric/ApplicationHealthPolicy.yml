    summary: >-
      The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy deployed applications. Allowed
      values are Byte

      values from zero to 100.

      The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of deployed
      applications that can

      be unhealthy before the application is considered in error.

      This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy deployed
      applications over the number

      of nodes where the application is currently deployed on in the cluster.

      The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
      nodes. Default

      percentage is zero. Default value: 0.
