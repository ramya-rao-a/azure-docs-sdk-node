    summary: >
      The filter for the health state of the nodes. It allows selecting nodes if
      they match the

      desired health states.

      The possible values are integer value of one of the following health
      states. Only nodes that

      match the filter are returned. All nodes are used to evaluate the cluster
      aggregated health

      state.

      If not specified, default value is None, unless the node name is
      specified. If the filter has

      default value and node name is specified, the matching node is returned.

      The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value could be a
      combination of these

      values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.

      For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches nodes with HealthState
      value of OK (2) and

      Warning (4).

      - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

      - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to
      return no results

      on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

      - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is
      2.

      - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The
      value is 4.

      - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The
      value is 8.

      - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is
      65535. Default

      value: 0.

    summary: >-
      Name of the node that matches the filter. The filter is applied only to
      the specified node, if

      it exists.

      If the node doesn't exist, no node is returned in the cluster health chunk
      based on this

      filter.

      If the node exists, it is included in the cluster health chunk if the
      health state matches the

      other filter properties.

      If not specified, all nodes that match the parent filters (if any) are
      taken into

      consideration and matched against the other filter members, like health
      state filter.
