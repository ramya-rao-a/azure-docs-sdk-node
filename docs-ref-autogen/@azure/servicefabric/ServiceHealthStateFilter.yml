  Defines matching criteria to determine whether a service should be included as
  a child of an

  application in the cluster health chunk.

  The services are only returned if the parent application matches a filter
  specified in the

  cluster health chunk query description.

  One filter can match zero, one or multiple services, depending on its
  properties.

    summary: >
      The filter for the health state of the services. It allows selecting
      services if they match

      the desired health states.

      The possible values are integer value of one of the following health
      states. Only services

      that match the filter are returned. All services are used to evaluate the
      cluster aggregated

      health state.

      If not specified, default value is None, unless the service name is
      specified. If the filter

      has default value and service name is specified, the matching service is
      returned.

      The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value could be a
      combination of these

      values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.

      For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches services with
      HealthState value of OK (2)

      and Warning (4).

      - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

      - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to
      return no results

      on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

      - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is
      2.

      - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The
      value is 4.

      - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The
      value is 8.

      - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is
      65535. Default

      value: 0.

    summary: >-
      Defines a list of filters that specify which partitions to be included in
      the returned cluster

      health chunk as children of the service. The partitions are returned only
      if the parent

      service matches a filter.

      If the list is empty, no partitions are returned. All the partitions are
      used to evaluate the

      parent service aggregated health state, regardless of the input filters.

      The service filter may specify multiple partition filters.

      For example, it can specify a filter to return all partitions with health
      state Error and

      another filter to always include a partition identified by its partition
      ID.

      The name of the service that matches the filter. The filter is applied
      only to the specified

      service, if it exists.

      If the service doesn't exist, no service is returned in the cluster health
      chunk based on this

      filter.

      If the service exists, it is included as the application's child if the
      health state matches

      the other filter properties.

      If not specified, all services that match the parent filters (if any) are
      taken into

      consideration and matched against the other filter members, like health
      state filter.
