    summary: >-
      The language for the audio payload in the input using the BCP-47 format of
      'language

      tag-region' (e.g: 'en-US').  If you know the language of your content, it
      is recommended that

      you specify it. The language must be specified explicitly for
      AudioAnalysisMode::Basic, since

      automatic language detection is not included in basic mode. If the
      language isn't specified or

      set to null, automatic language detection will choose the first language
      detected and process

      with the selected language for the duration of the file. It does not
      currently support

      dynamically switching between languages after the first language is
      detected. The automatic

      detection works best with audio recordings with clearly discernable
      speech. If automatic

      detection fails to find the language, transcription would fallback to
      'en-US'." The list of

      supported languages is available here:

      Defines the type of insights that you want the service to generate. The
      allowed values are

      'AudioInsightsOnly', 'VideoInsightsOnly', and 'AllInsights'. The default
      is AllInsights. If

      you set this to AllInsights and the input is audio only, then only audio
      insights are

      generated. Similarly if the input is video only, then only video insights
      are generated. It is

      recommended that you not use AudioInsightsOnly if you expect some of your
      inputs to be video

      only; or use VideoInsightsOnly if you expect some of your inputs to be
      audio only. Your Jobs

      in such conditions would error out. Possible values include:
      'AudioInsightsOnly',

      'VideoInsightsOnly', 'AllInsights'
