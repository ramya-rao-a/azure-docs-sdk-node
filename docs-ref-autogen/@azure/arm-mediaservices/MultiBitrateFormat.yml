  Describes the properties for producing a collection of GOP aligned
  multi-bitrate files. The

  default behavior is to produce one output file for each video layer which is
  muxed together with

  all the audios. The exact output files produced can be controlled by
  specifying the outputFiles

  collection.

    summary: >-
      The pattern of the file names for the generated output files. The
      following macros are

      supported in the file name: {Basename} - An expansion macro that will use
      the name of the

      input video file. If the base name(the file suffix is not included) of the
      input video file is

      less than 32 characters long, the base name of input video files will be
      used. If the length

      of base name of the input video file exceeds 32 characters, the base name
      is truncated to the

      first 32 characters in total length. {Extension} - The appropriate
      extension for this format.

      {Label} - The label assigned to the codec/layer. {Index} - A unique index
      for thumbnails. Only

      applicable to thumbnails. {Bitrate} - The audio/video bitrate. Not
      applicable to thumbnails.

      {Codec} - The type of the audio/video codec. {Resolution} - The video
      resolution. Any

      unsubstituted macros will be collapsed and removed from the filename.
