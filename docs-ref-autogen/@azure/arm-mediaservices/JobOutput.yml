    package: '@azure/arm-mediaservices'
    summary: >-
      A label that is assigned to a JobOutput in order to help uniquely identify
      it. This is useful

      when your Transform has more than one TransformOutput, whereby your Job
      has more than one

      JobOutput. In such cases, when you submit the Job, you will add two or
      more JobOutputs, in the

      same order as TransformOutputs in the Transform. Subsequently, when you
      retrieve the Job,

      either through events or on a GET request, you can use the label to easily
      identify the

      JobOutput. If a label is not provided, a default value of
      '{presetName}_{outputIndex}' will be

      used, where the preset name is the name of the preset in the corresponding
      TransformOutput and

      the output index is the relative index of the this JobOutput within the
      Job. Note that this

      index is the same as the relative index of the corresponding
      TransformOutput within its

      Transform.

      If the JobOutput is in a Processing state, this contains the Job
      completion percentage. The

      value is an estimate and not intended to be used to predict Job completion
      times. To determine

      if the JobOutput is complete, use the State property.
