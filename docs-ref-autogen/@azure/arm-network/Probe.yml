      The interval, in seconds, for how frequently to probe the endpoint for
      health status.

      Typically, the interval is slightly less than half the allocated timeout
      period (in seconds)

      which allows two full probes before taking the instance out of rotation.
      The default value is

      15, the minimum value is 5.
