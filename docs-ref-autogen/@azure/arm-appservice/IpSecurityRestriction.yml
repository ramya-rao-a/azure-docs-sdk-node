      X-Forwarded-Host

      (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Host#Examples).

      The matching logic is ..

      - If the property is null or empty (default), all hosts(or lack of) are
      allowed.

      - A value is compared using ordinal-ignore-case (excluding port number).

      - Subdomain wildcards are permitted but don't match the root domain. For
      example,

      *.contoso.com matches the subdomain foo.contoso.com

      but not the root domain contoso.com or multi-level foo.bar.contoso.com

      - Unicode host names are allowed but are converted to Punycode for
      matching.

      X-Forwarded-For

      (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For#Examples).

      The matching logic is ..

      - If the property is null or empty (default), any forwarded-for chains (or
      lack of) are

      allowed.

      - If any address (excluding port number) in the chain (comma separated)
      matches the CIDR

      defined by the property.


      X-Azure-FDID and X-FD-HealthProbe.

      The matching logic is exact match.
