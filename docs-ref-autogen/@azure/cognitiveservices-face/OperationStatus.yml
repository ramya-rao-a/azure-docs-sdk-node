    summary: >-
      Operation status: notstarted, running, succeeded, failed. If the operation
      is requested and

      waiting to perform, the status is notstarted. If the operation is ongoing
      in backend, the

      status is running. Status succeeded means the operation is completed
      successfully,

      specifically for snapshot taking operation, it illustrates the snapshot is
      well taken and

      ready to apply, and for snapshot applying operation, it presents the
      target object has

      finished creating by the snapshot and ready to be used. Status failed is
      often caused by

      editing the source object while taking the snapshot or editing the target
      object while

      applying the snapshot before completion, see the field "message" to check
      the failure reason.

      Possible values include: 'notstarted', 'running', 'succeeded', 'failed'
