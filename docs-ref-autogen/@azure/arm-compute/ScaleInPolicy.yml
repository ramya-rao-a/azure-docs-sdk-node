      The rules to be followed when scaling-in a virtual machine scale set.
      <br><br> Possible values

      are: <br><br> **Default** When a virtual machine scale set is scaled in,
      the scale set will

      first be balanced across zones if it is a zonal scale set. Then, it will
      be balanced across

      Fault Domains as far as possible. Within each Fault Domain, the virtual
      machines chosen for

      removal will be the newest ones that are not protected from scale-in.
      <br><br> **OldestVM**

      When a virtual machine scale set is being scaled-in, the oldest virtual
      machines that are not

      protected from scale-in will be chosen for removal. For zonal virtual
      machine scale sets, the

      scale set will first be balanced across zones. Within each zone, the
      oldest virtual machines

      that are not protected will be chosen for removal. <br><br> **NewestVM**
      When a virtual

      machine scale set is being scaled-in, the newest virtual machines that are
      not protected from

      scale-in will be chosen for removal. For zonal virtual machine scale sets,
      the scale set will

      first be balanced across zones. Within each zone, the newest virtual
      machines that are not

      protected will be chosen for removal. <br><br>
