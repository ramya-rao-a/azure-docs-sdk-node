      The endorsement key is an encryption key that is permanently embedded in
      the Trusted Platform Module (TPM)

      security hardware, generally at the time of manufacture. This private
      portion of the endorsement key is never

      released outside of the TPM. The public portion of the endorsement key
      helps to recognize a genuine TPM.

      The endorsement key is a base64 encoded value.

      The storage root key is embedded in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
      security hardware.

      It is used to protect TPM keys created by applications, so that these keys
      cannot be used without the TPM.

      Unlike the endorsement key (which is generally created when the TPM is
      manufactured), the storage root key

      is created when you take ownership of the TPM. This means that if you
      clear the TPM and a new user takes ownership,

      a new storage root key is created.

      The storageRootKey is a base64 encoded value.
